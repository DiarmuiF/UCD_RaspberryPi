# UCD_RaspberryPi
Scripts written by Diarmuid Finna as part of an internship
in UCD to develop an ADC/DAC using a Raspberry Pi to replace 
the NIDAQ systems currently in place in the UCD undergradutate
advanced labs.
The device uses Adafruit ADC and DAC chips which require setup and configuration of i2c
on the Raspberry Pi.
This procedure can be found here:
